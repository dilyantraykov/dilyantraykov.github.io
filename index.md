## <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Who am I?

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is **Dilyan Traykov** and I'm a young and ambitious software developer, amateur graphic designer, and professional party animal.

I currently work as a techical support engineer at [Progress](https://www.progress.com/) and deal with clients who build applications under the **WPF and Silverlight** frameworks. You can observe a small portion of my interaction with other programmers in the [support forums](https://www.telerik.com/forums/wpf). I also write articles for our [online documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/introduction) and maintain our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-docs).

In my spare time, however, I enjoy participating in coding challenges in websites such as [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/aeba2564473c943a5c7e7799b2122b940304311), [CodeFights](https://codefights.com/profile/dTraykov) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dtraykov94).

I also like working with **Photoshop** and I've spent a couple of months designing graphic materials for the [AIESEC](http://aiesec.bg/) NGO where I shortly took the position of **Team Leader of the Communications team**.

I recently purchased a GoPro and have started learning to edit my own videos with **Adobe Premiere**. You can have a look at the ones I've created in the following [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWFU5U48cQnTxrT-OaUY8vsdKb0VyfTGx).

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Education

### "Don't let schooling interfere with your education."

I studied in the [First English Language School](https://www.fels-sofia.org/) in **Sofia** from **2008** to **2013** where I focused on **English** and **Mathematics**. In this period I helped build the school's local **newspaper's website** and participated in the school's football team winning the **Goalscorer trophy** in the **2011 / 2012** season.

I then signed up for [Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/) and spent two years of studying **Computer Science** before deciding to drop out. During the same time I got an internship as a **Web Developer** at [Cranial Ink](https://www.cranialink.com/) where I mostly built and maitained **WordPress** websites.

I then rolled up for the [Telerik Academy](http://telerikacademy.com/) and in just over a year passed more than **15 courses**, most of which with **excellent grades**. I received certificates for my performance in the [C# Developer](http://my.telerikacademy.com/certificates/View/1587/30ce1177), [JavaScript Developer](https://my.telerikacademy.com/certificates/view/1684/dc9899b8), [Web Developer](https://my.telerikacademy.com/Certificates/View/1964/89e94b9a) and [Web Front-end Developer](http://my.telerikacademy.com/certificates/View/2179/d3b5390d) tracks and graduated from the academy with specialization in [Web Application Development](https://my.telerikacademy.com/certificates/view/1783/0b31ed0f).

## <i class="fas fa-hands-helping" aria-hidden="true"></i> Volunteer Work

I have volunteered on a number of projects including the **Elevation Music Festival** in 2012, the **Balkan Youth Festival** in Sandanski in 2012 and 2013 and just recently came back from a 6-week [AIESEC](http://aiesec.bg/) exchange project in **Wroclaw, Poland** where I teached kids of ages 5 to 15 on various subjects. 

## <i class="fa fa-beer" aria-hidden="true"></i> Other Interests

Apart from my 9 to 5 job as a programmer, I also *"work"* as a guide at the [New Sofia Pub Crawl](http://www.thenewsofiapubcrawl.com/) where I entertain foreigners with my **stupid jokes**, **lame dance moves** and **boring stories**.

As for activities, I really enjoy **board games**, **football**, **billiards**, **tennis**, **beer pong** and pretty much any interaction which stimulates my body and brain.

I sometimes participate in different marathons and take pride in my achievements in [Vitosha 100](http://vitosha100km.bg/) (100 km), [Brutus Run](http://brutusrun.com/) (21 km) and [The Big Tech Run](http://techrun.bg/the-big-tech-run/) (10 km).
